Hello, this is my very first project, completed for my individual assignment in the second week of classes in the first semester of college, for the Front-End Development subject, using only HTML and CSS. The project focuses on developing a login interface. Through this endeavor, I've gained invaluable practical experience in web development fundamentals, while also advancing my proficiency in front-end technologies.
